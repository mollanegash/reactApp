<h1>History</h1>
<p>This is a purchase order processing database of Boston Papers Company. The company produces
papers and sells them to office supply retail stores. The following is a description of the order
processing database and other relevant information.
1. The customers of Boston Papers Company are retail office supply stores (e.g., Officemax,
Officedepot, Staples, Walmart, Target, etc.). Each customer has one headquarter and one or
more branch stores in MA. Note that you should not create an entity for Boston Papers
Company itself.
2. For each customer headquarter, we want to store the name of the customer ((e.g., Officemax,
Officedepot, Staples, Walmart, Target, etc.), address, and phone number.
2. For each branch store of a customer, we want to keep a branch number, address, and phone
number. A branch number is an integer starting with 1 and is not unique among all branch
stores. It is unique only among those that belong to the same retail store. For example,
Officemax has three branch stores and their branch numbers are 1, 2, and 3; Officedepot has
two branch stores and their branch numbers are 1 and 2.
3. Boston Papers produces many different types of papers and each type of paper has a unique
type number, size, weight, and unit price.
4. An order is issued by a retail store headquarter. For each order, we want to keep the following
information.
 (1) A unique order number
(2) The retail store who issued the order
(3) Order date and order amount (in Dollars)
(4) The employee(s) of the Boston Papers who handle the order
5. An order consists of one or more suborders. Each suborder has a suborder number. This
suborder number is an integer starting with 1 and is not unique among all suborders. It is
unique only among those that belong to a particular order. A suborder is shipped to exactly
one branch store. A suborder includes one or more paper types. In addition to the suborder
number, for each suborder, we want to keep the following information in the database:
(1) The branch store the suborder is shipped to
(2) Required shipping date
(3) Actual shipping date
(4) Quantity of each paper type included in the suborder </p>
